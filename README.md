# About
I created this repository based on my experience while learning to use CI4. I am very grateful that I can learn CI4 material for free through Sandhika Galih's youtube. In this repository there are several materials:
1. Basic introduction of MVC
2. How to Install Code Igniter 4
3. Initial configuration concept when using Code Igniter 4
4. How to create a model and connect to a database
